        The purpose of this project is to look at the differences in PGA Tour golf statistics from 2010 to 2018, specifically how distance is impacting the game. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the PGA Tour to assemble a dataset on all player statistics from 2010 to 2018.

        After assembling the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of player statistics. Factors I looked at included trends in driving, greens in regulation, putting and birdies made. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

        Due to the current circumstances of COVID-19 the PGA tour has postponed play for 2020. The first tournament is scheduled for June 11th, 2020.
